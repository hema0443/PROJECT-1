# PROJECT-1

ABSTRACT:
This project proposes an Automated Car Parking System using Arduino, sensors, and actuators. The system aims to provide a convenient and efficient parking experience, minimizing the risk of accidents and damage to vehicles. Ultrasonic sensors detect the presence of vehicles and measure parking slot availability. Arduino Uno microcontroller processes sensor data and controls the system's operations, including automated parking and retrieval. The system also features a user-friendly interface, displaying parking slot availability and guiding drivers to available slots. This project demonstrates a cost-effective and innovative solution for automating car parking systems, enhancing urban mobility and reducing parking-related challenges.
This presents the idea and implementation of automated car parking system.Automation or automatic control, is the use of various systems for operating equipments or objects with minimal or reduced human intervention. The biggest benefit of automation is that it saves labour, however, it is also used to save energy and materials and to improve quality, accuracy and precision.In our project we are basically designing a parking system where one has to just enter the details of his car (like car registration number) at entry gate and then leave his car there and the car will automatically get parked at the available parking slot. If the parking area is full, a warning message of “Parking is full!” will be displayed. In this way that person will be able to save his time and energy.

Goal :
The primary goal of an Automated Car Parking System (ACPS) using Arduino is to design and develop a efficient, safe, and user-friendly parking management system

System Components :
1. Arduino Uno Microcontroller: Processes sensor data and controls the system's operations.
2. Ultrasonic Sensors: Detect the presence of vehicles and measure parking slot availability.
3. Infrared Sensors: Detect vehicle presence and prevent accidents.
4. LCD Display: Displays parking slot availability and guides drivers.
5. Motorized Gates: Automated parking and retrieval system.
6. Power Supply: Powers the system's components.

System Operation :
1. Vehicle Detection: Ultrasonic sensors detect vehicle presence and measure parking slot availability.
2. Parking Slot Allocation: Arduino processes sensor data and allocates an available parking slot.
3. Guidance System: LCD display guides the driver to the allocated parking slot.
4. Automated Parking: Motorized gates open and close to facilitate automated parking.
5. Vehicle Retrieval: Driver uses a keypad or RFID system to initiate vehicle retrieval.
6. System Monitoring: Arduino continuously monitors the system's operations and sensor data.

Objective :
Key Objectives
1. Automates parking and retrieval: Reduces labor costs and minimizes the risk of accidents.
2. Optimizes parking slot allocation: Increases parking efficiency and reduces congestion.
3. Provides real-time monitoring: Enables efficient system management and maintenance.

CONCLUSION:
This Project proposes an idea of automated car parking system in contrast to manual parking which was dependent on car driver. This idea is implemented using sensors and microcontrollers. This type of automated parking model not only saves time, space and energy but also provides an intelligent way of parking which reduces problems like car collisions and accidents which may arise due to human error and negligence.
The Automated Car Parking System using Arduino is a innovative solution that provides a convenient, efficient, and safe parking experience. The system's automated parking and retrieval features reduce labor costs and minimize the risk of accidents. The use of ultrasonic sensors, infrared sensors, and motorized gates ensures a secure and reliable parking operation.
